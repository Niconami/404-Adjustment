new website tool which just is background maker
5 layers? should be not limited, order and layering needs to be taken into account
    force layer of solid color as bottom layer - else bad things i imagine - nono, let canvas deal with that
each layer needs 2 customisable colors, being the material and the shadow 
    - auto shadow at like color + 10% black/white?
            // third to specify which is transparent - checkbox
    shadow goes both in and out of circle - need control for that -behind/in front of main layer?
each layer has circles , specify size (range, just one size, or one size with random +/-?) 
            // better still, all 3 with select, dictates whether there is one or two boxes, sum to same width - Uniform, Range and 
need random source to float them along (probably rtl)
    perhaps seed system so the same background can be remade? --- seed suggests that changing eg size will change everything, might be best not to
render to a canvas - help with resizing and \/
NEED EXPORT TO uhhh literally any dimensions, maybe a quick select of 16:9/common 
need density control (of circles) too
DO THE CSS
add gradient so that is applied properly
write proper description once all features implemented (add github issues link? theres a lot that could go wrong)
